      "### Dependencies\n",
      "- The function depends on the `numpy` library, which is a popular Python library for numerical computing. It provides efficient data structures for multi-dimensional arrays (`ndarray`) and functions for performing operations on these structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Function Signature\n",
      "- `linear_regression(X, y)`: The function takes in two parameters:\n",
      "    - `X`: A 2D numpy array where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature of the sample.\n",
      "    - `y`: A 1D numpy array (or vector) that represents the target values or outputs associated with each sample in `X`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Process Steps:\n",
      "1. **Initialization**:\n",
      "    - `n = X.shape[0]`: Determines the number of samples in the dataset by extracting the size of the first dimension of `X`.\n",
      "    - `ones = np.ones((n, 1))`: Creates a column vector (numpy array) of ones with the same height as `X`. This column vector is used for incorporating the bias term (intercept) into the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Feature Augmentation**:\n",
      "    - `X = np.hstack((ones, X))`: Augments the original feature matrix `X` with a column of ones. This operation essentially appends a column on the left-hand side of `X`. This augmentation allows the model to include an intercept term in the linear equation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Model Coefficient Calculation (Theta or Beta values)**:\n",
      "    - `beta = np.linalg.inv(X.T.dot(X)).dot(X.T).dot(y)`: Computes the coefficients (parameters) of the linear regression model using the normal equation method.\n",
      "        - `X.T.dot(X)`: Calculates the dot product of the transpose of `X` with `X`, a key component in the normal equation.\n",
      "        - `np.linalg.inv(...)`: Finds the inverse of the matrix resulting from `X.T.dot(X)`.\n",
      "        - `.dot(X.T).dot(y)`: Multiplies the inverse of the above matrix with the transpose of `X` and then with the target vector `y`.\n",
      "    - The result, `beta`, is a numpy array where the first element represents the intercept term of the linear model, and the remaining elements correspond to the coefficients (slopes) of the respective features.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Usage:\n",
      "The provided example demonstrates how to utilize this function with a simple dataset consisting of inputs (`X`) and outputs (`y`). \n",
      "\n",
      "- The input features (`X`) range from 1 to 5 in a single-dimensional feature space. \n",
      "- The output (`y`) is directly proportional to the input, following a simple linear relationship (`y = 2x`).\n",
      "\n",
      "After calling `linear_regression(X, y)`, the function calculates and prints the `Intercept` and `Slope` of the linearly fitted model. Given the input data, it's expected to find an intercept of 0 (or very close to it, allowing for numerical precision issues) and a slope of 2, which perfectly models the relationship (`y = 2x`) indicated by the sample dataset.\n",

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "This implementation is an illustrative and straightforward example of linear regression applied to a simplistic problem.

       "'Page: NebulaGraph\\nSummary: NebulaGraph is an open-source distributed graph database built for super large-scale graphs with milliseconds of latency. NebulaGraph adopts the Apache 2.0 license and  also  comes with a wide range of data visualization tools.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Vector database\\nSummary: A vector database, vector store or vector search engine is a database that can store vectors (fixed-length lists of numbers) along with other data items. Vector databases typically implement one or more Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms, so that one can search the database with a query vector to retrieve the closest matching database records.\\nVectors are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data, with the number of dimensions ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands, depending on the complexity of the data being represented. A vector\\'s position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, as well as images, audio, and other types of data, can all be vectorized.\\nThese feature vectors may be computed from the raw data using machine learning methods such as feature extraction algorithms, word embeddings or deep learning networks. The goal is that semantically similar data items receive feature vectors close to each other.\\nVector databases can be used for similarity search, multi-modal search, recommendations engines, large language models (LLMs), etc.\\nVector databases are also often used to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a method to improve domain-specific responses of large language models. The retrieval component of a RAG can be any search system, but is most often implemented as a vector database. Text documents describing the domain of interest are collected, and for each document or document section, a feature vector (known as an \"embedding\") is computed, typically using a deep learning network, and stored in a vector database. Given a user prompt, the feature vector of the prompt is computed, and the database is queried to retrieve the most relevant documents. These are then automatically added into the context window of the large language model, and the large language model proceeds to create a response to the prompt given this context.\\n\\nPage: Prompt engineering\\nSummary: Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.\\nA prompt for a text-to-text language model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat\\'s little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem about leaves falling\", or a longer statement including context, instructions, and conversation history. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as asking the model to complete \"maison → house, chat → cat, chien →\" (the expected response being dog), an approach called few-shot learning.\\nWhen communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\". Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.'"

It was previously based on PaLM, and initially the LaMDA family of large language models.\\nLaMDA had been developed and announced in 2021, but it was not released to the public out of an abundance of caution. OpenAI\\'s launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 and its subsequent popularity caught Google executives off-guard and sent them into a panic, prompting a sweeping response in the ensuing months. After mobilizing its workforce, the company launched Bard in February 2023, which took center stage during the 2023 Google I/O keynote in May and was upgraded to the Gemini LLM in December. Bard and Duet AI were unified under the Gemini brand in February 2024, coinciding with the launch of an Android app, which would replace Google Assistant as the main virtual assistant on Android, Google Assistant, however, will stay as an optional assistant.\\nGemini has received lukewarm responses. It became the center of controversy in February 2024, when social media users reported that it was generating historically inaccurate images of historical figures as people of color, with conservative commentators decrying its alleged bias as \"wokeness\".\\n\\nPage: Gemini (language model)\\nSummary: Google Gemini is a family of multimodal large language models developed by Google DeepMind, serving as the successor to LaMDA and PaLM 2. Comprising Gemini Ultra, Gemini Pro, Gemini Flash, and Gemini Nano, it was announced on December 6, 2023, positioned as a competitor to OpenAI\\'s GPT-4. It powers the chatbot of the same name.'"

      "Summary: Swami Vivekananda (; Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɔndo] ; IAST: Svāmī Vivekānanda ; 12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world, and is the father of modern Indian nationalism who is credited with raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion in the late nineteenth century.\n",
      "Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards religion and spirituality. He later found his guru Ramakrishna and became a monk. After the death of Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent as a wandering monk and acquired first-hand knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to help them and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago at which he delivered his famous speech beginning with the words: \"Sisters and brothers of America ...\" while introducing Hinduism to Americans. He made such an impression there that an American newspaper described him as \"an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament\".\n",
      "After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures across the United States, England, and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern California), both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West. In India, he founded the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householders, and the Ramakrishna Mission, which provides charity, social work and education.\n",
      "Vivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India, and the most successful missionary of Vedanta to the Western world. He was also a major force in contemporary Hindu reform movements and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. He is now widely regarded as one of the most influential people of modern India and a patriotic saint. His birthday in India is celebrated as National Youth Day.\n",

      "Summary: Swami Vivekananda (1863–1902) was an Indian Hindu monk and a key figure in the introduction of Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the western world. He was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India and the most successful and influential missionaries of Vedanta to the Western world. Indian Nobel laureate poet Rabindranath Tagore's suggested to study the works of Vivekananda to understand India. He also told, in Vivekananda there was nothing negative, but everything positive.\n",
      "In last one century, hundreds of scholarly books have been written on Vivekananda, his works and his philosophy in different languages. Sister Nivedita, who was a disciple and a friend of Vivekananda, wrote two books The Master as I Saw Him and Notes of some wanderings with the Swami Vivekananda. The first one was published in 1910 and the second one was published in 1913. Sister Gargi's lifelong research work, a series of six volumes of books, Swami Vivekananda in the West: New Discoveries was first published in two volumes in 1957. In 1983–87, these series was republished in six volumes. Bengali scholar and critic Sankari Prasad Basu, who was a director of Swami Vivekananda Archives, Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture wrote several books on Vivekananda such as Vivekananda o Samakalin Bharatbarsha ((in Bengali) 7 volumes), Sahasya Vivekananda (in Bengali),\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now know the final answer\n",

      "Final Answer: Swami Vivekananda, born Narendranath Datta on 12 January 1863 in Calcutta, was a prominent Indian Hindu monk, philosopher, and the chief disciple of the mystic Ramakrishna. Coming from an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family, he showed an early inclination towards spirituality and religion. After meeting his guru, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda became a monk and, following Ramakrishna's death, traveled extensively across the Indian subcontinent as a wandering monk. His journey led him to deeply understand the conditions of the Indian people under British rule, motivating him to seek ways to help them. Vivekananda gained international fame after his speech at the 1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago, where he introduced Hinduism to the Western world. He spent years lecturing in the United States, England, and Europe, founded the Vedanta Societies in New York and San Francisco, and back in India, established the Ramakrishna Math and Mission. Vivekananda's teachings and works made him one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers of his time, both in India and abroad.\u001b[0m\n",
